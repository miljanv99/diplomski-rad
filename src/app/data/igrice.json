There are many Sims games, from main games like this one to the frequent expansion packs and add-ons: all proving the enduring popularity of the series. As with the other games and expansion packs in the series, you control the life of your Sims completely – or almost completely – as they go through life, buying or building a home, getting a job or getting into the dating scene. There were no defined story arcs in the original game, but later expansion packs and add-ons issued challenges to the Sims, giving them missions to perform or career paths to follow. This game is still largely a sandbox game which gives you plenty of scope to decide what your Sims should be doing with their lives.", "rating": "PEGI 18", "developer": "Maxis", "publisher": "Electronic Arts", "releaseDate": "2 September 2014", "genre":["Simulation","Single player"], "minimumConfig":{
